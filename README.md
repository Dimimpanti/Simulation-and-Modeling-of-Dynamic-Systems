# Simulation and Modeling of Dynamic Systems – Laboratory Assignments

This repository contains laboratory assignments developed for the undergraduate course **Simulation and Modeling of Dynamic Systems**, offered in the 8th semester.

The purpose of these labs is to study dynamic system modeling and parameter estimation methods through simulation and theoretical analysis using MATLAB.



## Lab 1 – Linear Parameterization and Least Squares

This lab focuses on:

- Mathematical modeling of dynamic systems  
- Linear parameterization of unknown parameters  
- Application of the Least Squares (LS) method for parameter estimation  
- Evaluation of estimation accuracy  

The systems studied include:

- A mass–spring–damper mechanical system  
- An RLC electrical circuit  

Simulations were conducted to compare real and estimated outputs. The effect of measurement noise on parameter estimation was also examined.


## Lab 2 – Real-Time Parameter Estimation

This lab investigates adaptive estimation techniques and real-time identification methods.

Main topics include:

- Gradient-based adaptive estimation  
- Lyapunov-based parameter estimation  
- Parallel and mixed adaptive structures  
- Identification of linear state-space systems  
- Nonlinear system parameter estimation  

Different input signals and noise conditions were tested to analyze convergence properties, robustness, and stability of the estimators.

## Tools

All simulations and numerical experiments were implemented in MATLAB.
